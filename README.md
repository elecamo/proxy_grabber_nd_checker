# proxy_grabber_nd_checker
proxy grabber and checker


The first script, "grabber", is a Python script that retrieves a list of proxy addresses from a source, such as a website or a file. The retrieved proxy addresses are then stored in a list for further use.

The second script, "checker", is a Python script that takes the list of proxy addresses obtained from the proxy grabber and checks each one for functionality. This script tests the proxy by making a request to a specified URL using the proxy. If the request is successful, the proxy is considered functional and is added to a list of working proxies. If the request fails, the proxy is considered non-functional and is not added to the list of working proxies.

Both scripts work together to provide a list of functional proxy addresses that can be used for tasks such as scraping websites, bypassing IP restrictions, or anonymizing web traffic.
